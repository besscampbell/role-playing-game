- *Battle system*
--> e.g. prom queen dance off with the blorgon from OuterPlanet16.
--> points accumulated from dance-off style

- *Level up*
--> Have characters go from Level 1 to Level 2, etc.
--> Each level should come with new abilities/attributes/powers (e.g. strength: L1 (100) vs strength: L2 (200))
